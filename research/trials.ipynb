      "\n",
      "1. Negative Points Calculation (each nutrient is capped at 10 points):\n",
      " a. Energy: 36.1% of INR → (36.1/100) × 10 = 3.61 points\n",
      " b. Sugars: 0% of INR → 0 points\n",
      " c. Saturated Fat: 260% of INR would be 26 points if uncapped; however, we cap this nutrient at 10 points.\n",
      " d. Sodium: 41.8% of INR → (41.8/100) × 10 = 4.18 points\n",
      " Total Negative Points = 3.61 + 0 + 10 + 4.18 = 17.79\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Positive Points Calculation (each nutrient is capped at 5 points):\n",
      " a. Protein: 1.0% of INR is well below the source threshold (≥10% INR) so it does not qualify for a positive score → 0 points\n",
      " b. Fiber: Data not available, so 0 points\n",
      " Total Positive Points = 0 + 0 = 0\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Raw Score and Normalization:\n",
      " Raw Score = (Total Positive – Total Negative) + 40 = (0 – 17.79) + 40 = 22.21\n",
      " Since the raw score range is 0–50 (where 0 represents the worst nutrition and 50 the best), we scale it to 0–100 by multiplying by 2:\n",
      " Final INR Score = 22.21 × 2 ≈ 44.42\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Grade Interpretation (using the provided levels):\n",
      " Score between 40–59 is “Average” which corresponds to a grade “C”.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Health Warnings and Positive Claims:\n",
      " Health Warnings: The very high saturated fat level (260% of the INR baseline) is a major concern.\n",
      " Positive Claims: None, as neither protein nor fiber meets the thresholds.\n",
